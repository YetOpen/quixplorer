### About radish BDD testing

With version 2.5.5 we included some automated testing
using the BDD test tool [radish](https://github.com/timofurrer/radish/).

Currently we only have some automated tests for the 'download multiple files' feature.

For more detailed information, see [doc/testing.md](doc/testing.md).
